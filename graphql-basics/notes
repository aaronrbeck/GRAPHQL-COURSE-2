Basics:
npm run start  - inside graphql-basics folder
Git initialized folder: GRAPHQL-COURSE-2


Lessons:
Section 1
Lectures

Section 2 - Graphql basics schemas and queries
9 - set up babel and npm init
10 - an import/export lesson, I skipped
11 - set up index.js with graphql-yoga, defined typedef and resolver objects
12 - lesson on scalar types - skipped
13 - Nodemon added npm install nodemon --save-dev, changed package.json start script to run nodemon through babel     "start": "nodemon src/index.js --exec babel-node",
14 - creating custom types
15 - operation arguments, 
    added greeting with an optional name argument
    there are 4 arguments passed to every resolver: (parent, args, ctx, info)
16 - arrays intro, did not push
17 - array partII, custom array
18 - relational data did not push
19 - relational data: arrays
20 - comment challenge set up, aded type Comment to type defs, set up dummy comments data, set up a query->comments resolver
21 - comment challenge: comment user relationship
22 - comment challenge: comment post relationship established in type field and resolvers

Section 3: mutations
23: lecture?
24: set up first mutation, added uuid dependancy for randomly generated id, uuid documentation has multiple ways it can produce id's
25: createPost and createComment mutations added - Currently getting an erro in playground about non-nullable field when I use the createPost mutation
26: added rest spread operator, also plugins to .babelrc
    
    npm install babel-plugin-transform-object-rest-spread
    npm WARN apollo-cache-control@0.1.1 requires a peer of graphql@0.10.x - 0.13.x but none is installed. You must install peer dependencies yourself.

    npm WARN grap
    a preset is nothing more than a collection of plugins grouped together to provide some cohesive behavior
    in this case we added the plugin seperatly for some reason
-
27: defined input types createUser, createPost, and createComment to make argument inputs easier to handle,  and updated resolver with args.data. 
28/29: added delete user mutation/ added deletePost and deleteComment mutations















Where I'm stuck





How I got unstuck

25 instructor answered question
    in my Post resolver I had: Post:{
        author(parent, args, ctx, info){
            //the Post information lives on the parent argument so we can use that to figure out which user object needs to get returned
            return users.find(()=>
        {
            return users.id === parent.author
        })
        instructor stated: Thanks for the details! The issue is in this function. It's looking at users.id which doesn't exist. It should be looking at the id property of the array item instead.

    so I think I needed to change users.id to user.id because I don't want to look at the users array, I want to look at "this" specific user
    My createPost mutation is returning an error message about non-nullable fields, but I think I've filled out each field



26 we added     I never got unstuck, but just ignored the error message.
    I did run into some problems starting the server, but after re-watching video I tracked that
    down to having incorrect words in my .babelrc plugins file

    npm install babel-plugin-transform-object-rest-spread

    and I got the following error messages:

        npm WARN apollo-cache-control@0.1.1 requires a peer of graphql@0.10.x - 0.13.x but none is installed. You must install peer dependencies yourself.
        npm WARN apollo-server-core@1.4.0 requires a peer of graphql@^0.9.0 || ^0.10.0 || ^0.11.0 || ^0.12.0 || ^0.13.0 but none is installed. You must install peer dependencies yourself.
        npm WARN apollo-tracing@0.1.4 requires a peer of graphql@0.10.x - 0.13.x but none is installed. You must install peer dependencies yourself.
        npm WARN graphql-extensions@0.0.10 requires a peer of graphql@0.10.x - 0.13.x but none is installed. You must install peer dependencies yourself.
        npm WARN graphql-subscriptions@0.5.8 requires a peer of graphql@^0.10.5 || ^0.11.3 || ^0.12.0 || ^0.13.0 but none is installed. You must install peer dependencies yourself.
        npm WARN grap
    yet my package.json dependancy is     "graphql": "^14.3.1",
    reverting back to an early version does not seem like the move






27 when you get an error back saying that something is not defined you need to look to see if you needed to feed in a value somewhere in to a parameter
    Running the createPost mutation in playground I get: 
    {
  "data": null,
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "user is not defined",
      I am using an id that is hard coded into my user array to define the author
      when I use a non-existant author id I am gettting my error message
      how can the user not be defined?  it is not saying that the user does not exist, 
      just that it is not defined.  how can I be missing the clues?
