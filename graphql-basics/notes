Basics:
npm run start  - inside graphql-basics folder
Git initialized folder: GRAPHQL-COURSE-2
docker ps   docker kill  docker rm

Lessons:
Section 1
Lectures

Section 2 - Graphql basics schemas and queries
9 - set up babel and npm init
10 - an import/export lesson, I skipped
11 - set up index.js with graphql-yoga, defined typedef and resolver objects
12 - lesson on scalar types - skipped
13 - Nodemon added npm install nodemon --save-dev, changed package.json start script to run nodemon through babel     "start": "nodemon src/index.js --exec babel-node",
14 - creating custom types
15 - operation arguments, 
    added greeting with an optional name argument
    there are 4 arguments passed to every resolver: (parent, args, ctx, info)
16 - arrays intro, did not push
17 - array partII, custom array
18 - relational data did not push
19 - relational data: arrays
20 - comment challenge set up, aded type Comment to type defs, set up dummy comments data, set up a query->comments resolver
21 - comment challenge: comment user relationship
22 - comment challenge: comment post relationship established in type field and resolvers

Section 3: mutations
23: lecture?
24: set up first mutation, added uuid dependancy for randomly generated id, uuid documentation has multiple ways it can produce id's
25: createPost and createComment mutations added - Currently getting an erro in playground about non-nullable field when I use the createPost mutation
26: added rest spread operator, also plugins to .babelrc
    
    npm install babel-plugin-transform-object-rest-spread
    npm WARN apollo-cache-control@0.1.1 requires a peer of graphql@0.10.x - 0.13.x but none is installed. You must install peer dependencies yourself.
    npm WARN apollo-server-core@1.4.0 requires a peer of graphql@^0.9.0 || ^0.10.0 || ^0.11.0 || ^0.12.0 || ^0.13.0 but none is installed. You must install peer dependencies yourself.

    npm WARN grap
    a preset is nothing more than a collection of plugins grouped together to provide some cohesive behavior
    in this case we added the plugin seperatly for some reason
-
27: defined input types createUser, createPost, and createComment to make argument inputs easier to handle,  and updated resolver with args.data. 
28/29: added delete user mutation/ added deletePost and deleteComment mutations
30: structure refactoring: created schema.graphql - good lesson to watch again to understand ctx, etc.
        # connected to index via Graphql server path directory at bottom of index.js
    since nodmon does not autmatically look at schema.graphql files we connected nodemon via
    extension configuration tool using the ext argument in start scripts
    moved static data to it's own file - structure (via db.js) will be same as when we are using a real database
    context property discussed to use with db.js - added context to the gqlyoga object at bottom of index.js
    import db.js to index.js
    desctructured ctx to access db.js
31: refactor into seperate files to resolvers folder
    imported each file into index.js, and added them to a resolvers oject in the gql server
32: added updateUser mutation to schema
33a: added updatePost mutation - on my own
33b: added updateComment mutation - initially I forgot to return comment which resulted in playground warning: cannont return null for non-nullable

Section 4: subscriptions
34: intruduction lecture
35: set up a dummy introductory subscriptions
36: set up a comment subscription in subscription.js and called pubsub on createComment in mutation.js
37: post subscription challenge - fell flat on my face - need to walk through again how everything refrences each other
38: post subscription added
39: comment subscription challenge
40: enums: added enum mutationtype to shchema.graphql and modified payload mutation fields as necessary

PartII
Section 5: 
41: Section introduction video 
42: Prisma introduction prisma is an ORM  that works with any database
43: pirsma initial setup with sqldatabase at heroku
    heroku: resources -> search for heroku postgres -> name and provision it
    -> view credentials
    he set up docker
44: windows setup
45:ubunto setup
46: set up prisma, 
    created graphgl-prisma folder,
    prisma init, naming it prisma, SSL Y, don't generate language, removed schema property from docker-compose, 
    docker-compsose up -d prisma deploy
    at this point there is a playground at localhost:4466 which is on the prisma api
    the cool thing about prisma is that it writes the mutations queries, and subsciptions for whatever types we have defined in datamodel.prisma for us




47: explored mutations and queries using playground docs
    wrote first user to database and explored postgres db via pgadmin did not push

-Where I'm stuck
38 updatePost mutation will not affect the Boolean status of published
39: testing comment subscription:
    ok: subscritions to creates work
    probmlem: subscriptions to update: subscription page seems frozen? seems odd behavior
        update mutation is returning the update ok, so where does the problem lie?
    ok: subscriptions to delete: subscription seems to see the delete, but
    resovled problem: I get a data null error deletedComments is not defined for return value in the deleteComment mutation
        this last one i would guess that I am not handling my deletedComment catch array correctly
        ** tracked this down to another extra s, I had deletedComments when I needed deletedComment for my return value in my deletecomment mutation

47: my postgres instance is not automatically creating the updated at or the created at columns - why not?

How I got unstuck

25 instructor answered question
    in my Post resolver I had: Post:{
        author(parent, args, ctx, info){
            //the Post information lives on the parent argument so we can use that to figure out which user object needs to get returned
            return users.find(()=>
        {
            return users.id === parent.author
        })
        instructor stated: Thanks for the details! The issue is in this function. It's looking at users.id which doesn't exist. It should be looking at the id property of the array item instead.

    so I think I needed to change users.id to user.id because I don't want to look at the users array, I want to look at "this" specific user
    My createPost mutation is returning an error message about non-nullable fields, but I think I've filled out each field



26 we added     I never got unstuck, but just ignored the error message.
    I did run into some problems starting the server, but after re-watching video I tracked that
    down to having incorrect words in my .babelrc plugins file

    npm install babel-plugin-transform-object-rest-spread

    and I got the following error messages:

        npm WARN apollo-cache-control@0.1.1 requires a peer of graphql@0.10.x - 0.13.x but none is installed. You must install peer dependencies yourself.
        npm WARN apollo-server-core@1.4.0 requires a peer of graphql@^0.9.0 || ^0.10.0 || ^0.11.0 || ^0.12.0 || ^0.13.0 but none is installed. You must install peer dependencies yourself.
        npm WARN apollo-tracing@0.1.4 requires a peer of graphql@0.10.x - 0.13.x but none is installed. You must install peer dependencies yourself.
        npm WARN graphql-extensions@0.0.10 requires a peer of graphql@0.10.x - 0.13.x but none is installed. You must install peer dependencies yourself.
        npm WARN graphql-subscriptions@0.5.8 requires a peer of graphql@^0.10.5 || ^0.11.3 || ^0.12.0 || ^0.13.0 but none is installed. You must install peer dependencies yourself.
        npm WARN grap
    yet my package.json dependancy is     "graphql": "^14.3.1",
    reverting back to an early version does not seem like the move






27 when you get an error back saying that something is not defined you need to look to see if you needed to feed in a value somewhere in to a parameter
    Running the createPost mutation in playground I get: 
    {
  "data": null,
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "user is not defined",
      I am using an id that is hard coded into my user array to define the author
      when I use a non-existant author id I am gettting my error message
      how can the user not be defined?  it is not saying that the user does not exist, 
      just that it is not defined.  how can I be missing the clues?

33: cannont return null for non-nullable
    I gotta figure this one out. I've run into this three times, why havn't I learned my lesson?
    ALWAYS RETURN SOMETHING
38: once again, the dreaded cannont return null for non-nullable field Subscription.post
    once again, same problem, in a function I had an object as plural when it should have been singular
39 once again, cannont return null for non-nullable field Subscription.comment
    I know the createComment mutation is working, as the playground returns the information,
    plus I can see it with comment query.  
    I have line by lined Subscription.js 3x
    I have line by lined the schema.graphql
    **finally found it as a misnamed object from when I copy and pasted some sections to use as a template
    ** problem was in the pubsub section of createComment on mutation.js
